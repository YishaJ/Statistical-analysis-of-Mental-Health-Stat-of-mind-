# Proportion Tests

## Overview: Tests for proportions of alcohol consumption, counsellors' availability, and major life events.

## Hypothesis Test for Alcohol Consumption
 H0: Proportion of people consuming alcohol is the same as proportion of people not consuming alcohol.
 
 H1: Proportion of people consuming alcohol is less than proportion of people not consuming alcohol.

 Output: 
 X-squared = 93.845, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
 
 Conclusion: Reject H0 since p-value < 0.05, meaning the proportion of people consuming alcohol is less than those not consuming alcohol for people having mental health issues.

## Hypothesis Test for Counsellors Availability
 H0: Proportion of people having counsellors in their area is the same as proportion of people not having counsellors.

 H1: Proportion of people having counsellors is less than proportion of people not having counsellors.

 Output: 
 X-squared = 18.605, df = 1, p-value = 8.04e-06

 Conclusion: Reject H0 since p-value < 0.05, meaning the proportion of people having counsellors is less than those not having counsellors for people having mental health issues.

## Hypothesis Test for Major Life Events
 H0: Proportion of people who have experienced a major life event is the same as proportion of people who have not.

 H1: Proportion of people who have experienced a major life event is greater than those who have not.

 Output:
 X-squared = 0.405, df = 1, p-value = 0.2623
 
 Conclusion: Fail to reject H0 since p-value > 0.05, meaning there is no significant difference in the proportion of people who have experienced a major life event compared to those who haven't for people having mental health issues.

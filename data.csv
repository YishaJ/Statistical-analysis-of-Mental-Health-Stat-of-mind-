",Yes,No,"Mental health is a very broad area, it can vary from just feeling not good to major depression or major  psychological issues. Some may improve this by simply adopting the life style like exercises and good eating habits and some might end up in medications if it’s severe. But we all need to accept that at any one point in life/ time we all suffer from it, so acknowledging it and trying to work around it is the best way forward. Seeking help at right time and talking about it and getting support whether it’s at personal or professional level but talk about it before the damage is too late to rectify.  Also try and stay away from bad influences like social media, it can be helpful if used in right way but it can influence in bad way. Especially on today’s younger generation. It’s create a false image and people try to chase that image and then if it doesn’t work out they end up in major issues. So understand that what you always see is not a real world and it’s mainly fake image that has been created. So don’t fall for it. 
Good luck with the project. "
